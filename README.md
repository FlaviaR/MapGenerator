# MapGenerator
This project creates procedurally generated maps, based off of Red Blob's "Polygonal Map Generation for games" blog post<br>
See - http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/ <br><br>

This project is still in its infancy stages.<br><br>

You can see its current state at: https://cryptic-beach-77301.herokuapp.com/ <br><br>

<h5>To Do:</h5>
- Fix biome generation <br>
- Fix radial map generation. There should not be many open spots within it.<br>
- Add rivers <br>
- Allow for world map generation <br>
- Allow for addition of names on individual land masses
